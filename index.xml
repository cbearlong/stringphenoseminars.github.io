Tuesday, July 6, 2021  11:00, Isabel Garcia Garcia, UC Santa Barbara, KITP  Title: Bounce of Nothing
Abstract: Theories with compact extra dimensions are sometimes unstable to decay into a bubble of nothing &amp;ndash; an instability resulting in the destruction of spacetime. In this talk, I will discuss the existence of these bubbles in theories where the moduli fields that set the size of the extra dimensions are stabilized at a positive vacuum energy &amp;ndash; a necessary ingredient of any theory that aspires to describe the real world.</description>
