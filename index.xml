      <description>The talk series will be held via Zoom from 11:00AM-12:00PM EDT on Tuesdays, beginning June 16. Please register to the mailing list to receive the links.
The schedule of upcoming talks is as follows:
Tuesday, July 7, 2020  11:00, Naomi Gendler, Cornell  Title: BPS States and Extremal Black Holes at Infinite Distance.
Abstract: In this talk, I will present an analysis of the charge-to-mass ratio structure of BPS states in general infinite-distance limits of N=2 compactifications of Type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau three-folds, and use the results to sharpen the formulation of the Swampland Conjectures in the presence of multiple gauge and scalar fields.</description>

Tuesday, June 23, 2020  11:00, Niccol√≤ Cribiori, TU Wien  Title: The web of swampland conjectures and the TCC bound.
Abstract: The swampland program provides criteria to identify low energy effective theories consistent with quantum gravity. However, at present most of these criteria are conjectures and depend on unspecified order one parameters. In this talk, I will test some of these conjectures in specific examples and propose lower bounds for the corresponding parameters.</description>

      <description>This seminar series is designed to highlight the work of theorists early in their careers, in the broad topic of String Phenomenology. The talks are held virtually on Tuesdays, from 11 AM - 12 PM EST, in order to allow for maximum participation across the globe. All presentations will be by junior researchers who are not yet in permanent positions.
Talks will be given via Zoom. Please register to the mailing list to receive the links.</description>
