Tuesday, March 30, 2021  11:00, Lars Aalsma, UW Madison  Title: The Price of Curiosity: Information Recovery in de Sitter Space
Abstract: Recent works have revealed that the fine-grained entropy of a non-gravitating subsystem, when entangled with a gravitating region, can receive contributions from so-called quantum extremal islands. Applied to black holes, this reproduces the unitary Page curve for Hawking radiation.</description>
