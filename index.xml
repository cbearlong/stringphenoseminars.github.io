The schedule of upcoming talks is as follows:s
Tuesday, December 1, 2020  11:00, Max Hubner, Oxford  Title: Probing Higgs Bundles for Local G2-Manifolds
Abstract: M-theory on local G2-manifolds engineers 4d minimally supersymmetric gauge theories. This class of geometries admits a description in terms of a Higgs bundle over a 3d base and engineers a partially twisted 7d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory from which the 4d physics is derived.</description>

Tuesday, November 24, 2020  11:00, Callum Brodie, IPHT  Title: Flop transitions for complete intersection Calabi-Yaus
Abstract: A flop is one of the simplest topological transitions that a Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold can undergo, and flops frequently connect multiple CYs into a web having a single moduli space. Typically, the existence of flops for a given CY has been detected from flops of a toric ambient space.</description>

      <description>This seminar series is designed to highlight the work of theorists early in their careers, in the broad topic of String Phenomenology. The talks are held virtually on Tuesdays, from 11 AM - 12 PM EST, in order to allow for maximum participation across the globe. All presentations will be by junior researchers who are not yet in permanent positions.
Talks will be given via Zoom. Please register to the mailing list to receive the links.</description>
