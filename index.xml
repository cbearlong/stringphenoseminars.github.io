Tuesday, May 25, 2021  11:00, Andrea Sangiovanni, University of Trieste/INFN  Title: Open string methods and Gopakumar-Vafa invariants
Abstract: Topological invariants of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds, besides being of intrinsic interest for mathematicians, are objects that have great consequences in physics, as their properties are believed to capture instantonic effects in effective field theories arising from string compactifications.</description>
