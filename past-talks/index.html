<p>Title: <em>The Price of Curiosity: Information Recovery in de Sitter Space</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have revealed that the fine-grained entropy of a non-gravitating subsystem, when entangled with a gravitating region, can receive contributions from so-called quantum extremal islands. Applied to black holes, this reproduces the unitary Page curve for Hawking radiation. In this talk, I will show how these results can be applied to the thermal radiation measured by a static observer in de Sitter space. Focusing on JT gravity, I will emphasize the necessity of going beyond the thermal equilibrium of the Bunch-Davies state. We will see that a quantum extremal island can contribute to the fine-grained entropy, suggesting unitarity of the radiation, but this comes at a price: when the island appears a singularity forms that a static observer will eventually hit.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Anomalies of (0,4) SCFTs from wrapped D3 branes in F-theory</em></p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk we will consider macroscopically, a class of 2d (0,4) SCFTs living on black strings. The black strings are constructed by wrapping D3-branes on a curve inside the base of a (singular) elliptically fibered Calabiâ€”Yau three-fold. The asymptotic geometry in which the branes live in includes an ALE or ALF space which probes the D3 branes. Using macroscopic computations we will compute the various anomaly coefficients of the theory by reducing 6d N=(1,0) supergravity on the horizon of the black strings and extracting the coefficients of Chernâ€”Simons terms. As we will, see the inclusion of one-loop corrections from integrating out massive modes is essential. Given time we will make some comments on the microscopic computation.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Algorithmically solving the Tadpole Problem</em></p>
<p>Abstract: I demonstrate how to use differential evolutionary algorithms to find flux compactifications of M-theory on K3xK3. The assumption that a large numbers of moduli can be stabilized with fluxes within the tadpole bound is one of the corner stones of the String Landscape and was recently challenged by the Tadpole Conjecture. Explicitly showing moduli stabilization for manifolds with many moduli is highly challenging. On K3xK3 moduli stabilization is well understood and can be formulated exclusively in terms of integer matrices and their eigenvalues and -vectors. In particular, there is no knowledge of complicated period integrals or the corresponding Picard-Fuchs equations required. This makes this example predestined for a computer aided search. Using differential evolution we show that there are no smooth compactifications on K3xK3 with arbitrarily small flux M2-charge, in tension with the tadpole bound.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Tackling the SDC in AdS with CFTs</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, questions related to the Swampland Distance Conjecture (SDC) in AdS can be reformulated in the language of conformal manifolds. For AdS_5 backgrounds with eight or more supercharges, we find that for a large class of (and possibly all) infinite-distance points, there must exist a tower of massless higher-spin fields. On the conformal side, those points are those for which a sector of the CFT becomes free, and the tower follows from the presence of higher-spin conserved currents. We illustrate these results for type IIB compactifications on S^5 and its orbifolds.</p>

<p>Title: <em>New databases for model building: CICY orientifolds and GV invariants</em></p>
<p>Abstract: We present two recently computed explicit databases which could be relevant for model building in String Phenomenology. The first contains two million orientifolds supporting O3 and O7 planes that can be constructed for the list of Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds (CICYs). The second is an explicit computation of all the genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) invariants for such class of CYs, up to total degree 10. In both instances, we find interesting phenomena arising. In the orientifold scan, we discover a plethora of new cases with non-vanishing h11-odd, which can support C2 and B2 axions, as well as thraxions. We also observe the existence of conifold singularities that lie on-top of orientifold planes and thus cannot be deformed, but can still be resolved. We argue that on the resolution side we find a vast set of (possibly previously unknown) CY manifolds.
In the GV scan, we find interesting hierarchies between the rate of growth of the invariants along different directions inside the Picard lattice. Such hierarchies have an application in complex structure moduli stabilization aiming at achieving a very small W0 superpotential, as well as winding inflation models. Furthermore, we eliminate redundancies in the list of CICYs, by a systematic implementation of Wall&rsquo;s theorem.</p>

<p>Title: <em>The Convex Hull Swampland Distance Conjecture and Bounds on Non-geodesics</em></p>
<p>Abstract: The Swampland Distance Conjecture (SDC) restricts the geodesic distances that scalars can traverse in effective field theories as they approach points at infinite distance in moduli space. We propose that, when applied to the subset of light fields in effective theories with scalar potentials, the SDC restricts the amount of non-geodesicity allowed for trajectories along valleys of the potential. This is necessary to ensure consistency of the SDC as a valid swampland criterium at any energy scale across the RG flow. We provide a simple description of this effect in moduli space of hyperbolic space type, and products thereof, and obtain critical trajectories which lead to maximum non-geodesicity compatible with the SDC. We recover and generalize these results by expressing the SDC as a new Convex Hull constraint on trajectories, characterizing towers by their scalar charge to mass ratio in analogy to the Scalar Weak Gravity Conjecture. We show that recent results on the asymptotic scalar potential of flux compatifications near infinity in moduli space precisely realize these critical amounts of non-geodesicity. Our results suggest that string theory flux compactifications lead to the most generic potentials allowing for maximum non-geodesicity of the potential valleys while respecting the SDC along them. Based on arXiv:2012.00034 with Angel M. Uranga and Irene Valenzuela.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Neural Network Approximations for Calabi-Yau metrics</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Ricci flat metrics for Calabi-Yau threefolds are not known analytically. In this work, we employ techniques from machine learning to deduce numerical approximations to flat metrics for the Fermat quintic, for the Dwork quintic, and for the Tian-Yau manifold. This investigation employs a single neural network architecture that is capable of approximating Ricci flat Kaehler metrics for several Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimensions two and three. We show that measures that assess the Ricci flatness of the geometry decrease after training by three orders of magnitude. This is corroborated on the validation set, where the improvement is more modest. Finally, we demonstrate that discrete symmetries of manifolds can be learned in the process of learning the metric.</p>

<p>Title: <em>de Sitter Quantum Breaking, Swampland Conjectures and Thermal Strings</em></p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that the quantum breaking approach and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture can both lead to bounds of the same functional form for the scalar potential. The proposal that dS quantum breaking is induced by tracing over states beyond the dS horizon gives rise to a thermal matter component, which can be straightforwardly generalized to string theory. Imposing a censorship of quantum breaking, we recover in the low temperature regime the no eternal inflation bound. The stronger dS swampland conjecture bound arises, under certain assumptions, in the mysterious high temperature regime of string theory.</p>

<p>Title: <em>A New Spin on the Weak Gravity Conjecture</em></p>
<p>Abstract: The mild form of the Weak Gravity Conjecture states that quantum or higher-derivative corrections should decrease the mass of large extremal charged black holes at fixed charge. This allows extremal black holes to decay, unless protected by a symmetry (such as supersymmetry). We reformulate this conjecture as an integrated condition on the effective stress tensor capturing the effect of quantum or higher-derivative corrections. In addition to charged black holes, we also consider rotating BTZ black holes and show that this condition is satisfied as a consequence of the c-theorem, proving a spinning version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture. We also apply our results to a five-dimensional boosted black string with higher-derivative corrections. The boosted black string has a BTZÃ—S2 near-horizon geometry and, after Kaluza-Klein reduction, describes a four-dimensional charged black hole. Combining the spinning and charged Weak Gravity Conjecture we obtain positivity bounds on the five-dimensional Wilson coefficients that are stronger than those obtained from charged black holes alone. This talk is based on work with L. Aalsma, G. Loges, and G. Shiu.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Topological gravity as the early phase of our universe</em></p>
<p>Abstract: I will present a scenario for the early universe that is motivated by dualities in string theory. Dualities, as well as puzzles of cosmology, naturally lead to considering a topological theory of gravity. Using Witten&rsquo;s 4d topological gravity as one realization, one can estimate phenomenological properties of the CMB fluctuations whose power spectrum is controlled by the conformal anomaly coefficients a and c. In particular, the strength of the fluctuations is controlled by 1/a and the tilt by cg^2 where g is the coupling constant of topological gravity. The positivity of c, a consequence of unitarity, leads automatically to an IR tilt for the power spectrum. In addition, the topological nature of gravity implies the absence of primordial tensor modes. Finally, I will discuss some analogies with particle physics that provide further clarification of this picture.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Numerical Calabi-Yau metrics from holomorphic networks</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Calabi-Yau metrics have many important applications in string compactification. However, it is generally believed that no closed-form expression exists. In this talk, I will introduce machine learning inspired methods for computing numerical Calabi-Yau metrics and the implementation using Tensorflow/Keras. I will compare them with previous work and show some results for manifolds with little or no symmetry.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Infinite Distance, Emergent Strings and Quantum Corrections in 4D N=1</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Infinite distance limits in the KÃ¤hler moduli space of F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds can feature tensionless heterotic or type II strings that emerge from wrapping D3-branes on shrinking curves. If a gauge coupling vanishes in the limit, the Weak Gravity and Distance Conjectures predict an infinite tower of light, (super-)extremal states. Such a tower is provided by the excitations of an emergent heterotic string. In this talk, I will first review the geometry of these limits at the classical level and argue that the resulting tensionless string is unique. We will then discuss how quantum corrections to the 4D $N=1$ effective action influence the classical limits and the tower of WGC states. We will see that the inclusion of \alphaâ€™-corrections is crucial for the consistency of the theory.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Supersymmetric Flux Vacua and Calabi-Yau Modularity</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Most familiar constructions in string theory are rooted in the complex geometry of the compact dimensions. On the other hand, much of modern mathematics focuses on arithmetic geometry, where we consider the properties of varieties over smaller fields such as Q. In this talk, following recent work (arXiv:2001.06022, arXiv:2010.07285) with S. Kachru and W. Yang, I will explain how string theory can be related to arithmetic. In particular, I will argue that supersymmetric flux vacua admit arithmetic structures closely related to those of elliptic curves, and moreover that these arithmetic structures are related to the geometry of the F-theory description of the flux compactification.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Automatic Enhancement in 6D Supergravity and F-theory Models</em></p>
<p>Abstract: We observe that in many 6D F-theory models, tuning a specific gauge group G and matter content M leads to an automatic enhancement to a larger gauge group G&rsquo; âŠƒ G and matter content M&rsquo; âŠƒ M. We propose that this is true for any theory G, M for which there exists a containing theory G&rsquo;, M&rsquo; that cannot be Higgsed down to G, M. I will discuss a number of examples, including non-Higgsable gauge factors, nonabelian gauge factors, abelian gauge factors, and exotic matter. In each of the discussed cases, tuning an F-theory model with the desired features produces either an enhancement or an inconsistency, often when the associated anomaly coefficient becomes too large. This principle applies to a variety of models in the apparent 6D supergravity swampland, including some of the simplest cases with U(1) and SU(N) gauge groups and generic matter, as well as infinite families of U(1) models with higher charges presented in the prior literature, potentially ruling out all these apparent swampland theories.</p>

<p>Abstract: In flux compactifications of type IIB string theory with D3 and seven-branes, the negative induced D3 charge localized on seven-branes leads to an apparently pathological profile of the metric sufficiently close to the source. With the volume modulus stabilized in a KKLT de Sitter vacuum this pathological region takes over a significant part of the entire compactification, threatening to spoil the KKLT effective field theory. I will argue that wrapped seven-branes can be thought of as bound states of more microscopic exotic branes. The low-energy worldvolume dynamics of a stack of $n$ such exotic branes is given by the  $(A_1,A_{n-1})$ Argyres-Douglas theory. Moreover, the splitting of the perturbative (in $\alpha'$) seven-brane into its constituent branes at the non-perturbative level resolves the apparently pathological region close to the seven-brane and replaces it with a region of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Einstein frame volume. While this region generically takes up an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of the compactification in a KKLT de Sitter vacuum we argue that small classical flux superpotentials dynamically ensure that KKLT de Sitter vacua are generically safe from dangerous corrections.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Towards realistic matter spectra in F-theory</em></p>
<p>Abstract: In this project I analyze in detail the exact massless vector-like spectrum of MSSM in F-theory compactified on elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfold. The massless zero modes are determined by line bundles over matter curves under the presence of gauge background. In realistic F-theory geometry, those line bundles we concerned turn into so-called root bundles, which are not computationally feasible on generic curves. We noticed that there exists so-called limit root construction for the matter curve to realize the global section counting on it under special complex structure choice. I will present an explicit example of indicating exactly three generations of quarks on a particular curve at the end and anticipate this method would further allows us to find complete matter spectra of MSSM in the future.</p>

<p>Title: <em>The Holographic Swampland</em></p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate whether Swampland constraints on the low-energy dynamics of weakly coupled string vacua in AdS can be related to inconsistencies of their putative holographic duals or, more generally, recast in terms of CFT data. In the first part of the talk, we shall illustrate how various swampland consistency constraints are equivalent to a negativity condition on the sign of certain mixed anomalous dimensions. This condition is similar to well-established CFT positivity bounds arising from causality and unitarity, but not known to hold in general. Our analysis will include LVS, KKLT, perturbative and racetrack stabilisation, and we shall also point out an intriguing connection to the Distance Conjecture. In the second part, we show how a different, recently derived inequality on mixed anomalous dimensions maps to novel constraints on four-derivative interactions on AdS. As an application, we use this to constrain the interactions of scalars with a non standard kinetic term, finding in particular that the DBI action for multiple scalar fields is at the boundary of the allowed region.

<p>Abstract: I will discuss the decay of charged black holes in de Sitter space. We
establish how the black hole mass and charge change over time due to
both Hawking radiation and Schwinger pair production as a function of
the masses and charges of the elementary particles in the theory. We
find a lower bound on the mass of charged particles by demanding that
large charged black holes evaporate back to empty de Sitter space, in
accordance with the thermal picture of the de Sitter static patch.
This constrains the allowed spectrum of charged particles in
supergravity and string theory de Sitter constructions in an
interesting way. This bound is satisfied by the charged spectrum of
the Standard Model. This bound has phenomenological implications for
the cosmological hierarchy problem and inflation.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Flop transitions for complete intersection Calabi-Yaus</em></p>
<p>Abstract: A flop is one of the simplest topological transitions that a Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold can undergo, and flops frequently connect multiple CYs into a web having a single moduli space. Typically, the existence of flops for a given CY has been detected from flops of a toric ambient space. However, for one of the most useful collections of CYs, namely complete intersection Calabi-Yaus (CICYs), the ambient space does not admit flops. But in his talk two weeks ago, Andrei deduced from line bundle cohomologies the existence of flops for CICYs. These hence require a different description. In my talk I will explain how to explicitly perform these flops, which will provide in particular a description of the CY after the transition as a complete intersection in a toric ambient space. Additionally, I will show how one can easily deduce from only the configuration matrix the presence and properties of these flops, and I will illustrate that essentially all CICYs admit (many) flops. Finally, I will use these ideas in a slightly different direction to show that one can often immediately write down all zeroth cohomologies from only the configuration matrix.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dark gauge sectors are ubiquitous in string theory. At some time in the early universe, gluons in these sectors confine into dark glueballs or hadrons, the phase transition known to be first-order for many choices of gauge groups and numbers of fermions. Such a transition produces a stochastic gravitational wave signal that might be measured in future searches. In this talk, we use a phenomenological matrix model to describe confinement in a dark gauge sector in order to estimate the gravitational wave signal produced in a dark confining transition. We focus on the case of pure Yang-Mills, as it shows up consistently in F-theory.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyze to which extent the KKLT proposal for the construction of de Sitter vacua in string theory is quantitatively controlled. Our focus is on the quality of the 10d supergravity approximation. As our main finding, we uncover and quantify an issue which one may want to call the &ldquo;singular-bulk problem&rdquo;. In particular, we show that, requiring the curvature to be small in the conifold region, one is generically forced into a regime where the warp factor becomes negative in a significant part of the Calabi-Yau orientifold. This implies true singularities, independent of the familiar, string-theoretically controlled singularities of this type in the vicinity of O-planes.</p>

<p>Abstract: D-branes are an important part in many string phenomenology models and can act as sources of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. They are employed in many setups, including the famous KKLT scenario. The linear supersymmetry of the background will be realized non-linearly after it is broken by a D-brane. Fundamentally, this leads to non-linear, so-called de Sitter, supergravity. In this talk I will show how the correct description of such theories in 4d non-linear supergravity looks like and how it is possible to include any supersymmetry breaking Dp-brane via a modification of the KÃ¤hler- and Superpotential into an initially N=1 supersymmetric model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The calculation of vector bundle cohomology represents a key ingredient in string phenomenology, being associated to the massless modes of both heterotic and Type II string compactifications. In this talk I report some recent progress in deriving closed-form expressions for line bundle cohomology on spaces of interest in string theory, which include complex surfaces such as compact toric surfaces, generalised del Pezzo surfaces and K3 surfaces, as well as Calabi-Yau threefolds. I will concentrate on the case of three-folds, where it turns out that line bundle cohomology encodes a wealth of information about flops and Gromov-Witten invariants. Finally, I will briefly discuss two phenomenology applications: the prospect of implementing a bottom-up approach to model building and flop transitions in heterotic string theory.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Dynamical Tadpoles and Weak Gravity Constraints</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Non-supersymmetric string models are plagued with tadpoles for dynamical fields, which signal uncanceled forces sourced by the vacuum. We argue that in certain cases, uncanceled dynamical tadpoles can lead to inconsistencies with quantum gravity, via violation of swampland constraints. We describe an explicit realization in a supersymmetric toroidal Z_2xZ_2 orientifold with D7-branes, where the dynamical tadpole generated by displacement of the D7-branes off its minimum leads to violation of the axion Weak Gravity Conjecture.
In these examples, cancellation of dynamical tadpoles provides consistency conditions for the configuration, of dynamical nature (as opposed to the topological conditions of topological tadpoles, such as RR tadpole cancellation in compact spaces). We show that this approach provides a re-derivation of the Z-minimization criterion for AdS vacua giving the gravitational dual of a-maximization in 4d N=1 toric quiver SCFTs.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Non-SUSY String Phenomenology from Z_2 x Z_2 Heterotic Orbifolds</em></p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the space of non-SUSY string models via two distinct routes: the tachyon-free O(16) x O(16) heterotic string in 10D and a tachyonic 10D heterotic string. We classify 4D Z_2 x Z_2 orbifolds descending from these two starting points in the free fermionic construction. Having found a potentially stable Standard-like model descending from the tachyonic 10D vacuum in arXiv:1912.00061, the approach of taking these models on equal footing with the non-tachyonic 10D models is justified provided that the tachyonic states are projected out in the four dimensional models. In both classes of models we find examples of Type 0 and Type 0bar models, i.e. models free of fermionic massless states and models free of twisted massless bosons, respectively. Moving beyond these extreme configurations we seek to classify tachyon-free vacua according to standard phenomenological criteria in both classes of model, where an SO(10) GUT is broken to the Pati-Salam subgroup. An analysis of the cosmological constant and misaligned supersymmetry in the two classes of models finds notable vacua in both cases in which N_b=N_f at the massless level.</p>

We consider a string theory-based scenario, in which the flavor symmetry arises from the compactification of extra dimensions. We observe that compactifications on toroidal orbifolds yield naturally discrete flavor symmetries that consist of traditional flavor symmetries as well as modular symmetries, combined in a so-called &ldquo;eclectic flavor group&rdquo;. More concretely, we will discuss the eclectic flavor groups of the two dimensional Z2 and Z3 Narain orbifolds.</p>

In the second part, if time permits, we will we present a correspondence between the 4d F-term N=1 scalar potential and a system of parallel BPS membranes. More concretely, we will show how each of the different terms in the formula for the potential is in one-to-one correspondence with the exchange of 3-forms, scalars and gravitons between the membranes.</p>

<p>Abstract: All Neural Networks, backbones of deep learning, are Gaussian Processes in infinite width limit and at initialization. Euclidean scalar field theory without interactions is shown to be a natural description of NNGP (Neural Network Gaussian Process), indicating an interesting correspondence between EFT and NNs. Finite width NN correlation functions can be computed using Feynman diagrams, by turning on interactions in the field theory. Overparameterization problem of NNs can be solved using Wilsonian renormalization group flow, as it describes the minimal non-Gaussian Process (NGP) using most relevant non-Gaussian (interaction) terms. Experiments support that one single parameter can correct GP correlation functions to NGP correlation functions. Output space dimensions and symmetries in NN architectures have interesting effects on the interaction strengths describing the NGP.</p>

<p>Abstract: A classical solution of string theory with a 4d de Sitter space-time could be a simple and well-controlled setting, where to connect to cosmological models. So far however, no such solution has been found. As will be reviewed, attempts in this direction are plagued by many no-go theorems, or by the difficulty for concrete 10d supergravity solutions to fit in the classical string regime. This situation agrees with recent de Sitter swampland conjectures. As will be shown, the latter can actually be verified quantitatively, with a surprisingly good agreement. This may hint at a deeper reason against classical de Sitter background, even though not all possibilities have for now been excluded.</p>

<p>Abstract: Much effort has recently been directed towards understanding and questioning KKLT as the prime example of dS constructions in string theory. The starting point of KKLT is to assume one has stabilized the complex structure moduli to a small superpotential W0. The final uplift to dS requires everything to happen in a strongly warped region, i.e. near a conifold. I present a mechanism to construct explicit models with CS moduli stabilized to small W0 near the conifold, showing that such solutions are fairly abundant. I will end with some remarks about the strained relationship between the AdS Distance Conjecture and the KKLT AdS vacuum.</p>

<p>Abstract: It has recently  emerged that the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) can be formulated in (at least) two different forms when massless scalars (moduli) are present. Rather than imposing constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of states in the spectrum, the second formulation, dubbed the Repulsive Force Conjecture (RFC), relies instead on determining bounds by analyzing the long range forces between them. Nonetheless, it is clear that these conjectures are related. In the talk, I will present a derivation in the context of tree level string theory, where we show how these fit together, and determine a series of states, present in the spectrum of a generic theory, that satisfy the RFC and the WGC, thus providing further evidence that these conjectures should hold in a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

I will introduce CYTools: a software package for constructing and analyzing CY hypersurfaces. These advances enable many applications to string compactifications. I will discuss two examples. First, studying large ensembles of CY threefolds with large Hodge numbers reveals that the Kahler cone of a generic CY hypersurface is extremely narrow. Consequently, control of the alpha prime expansion is strongly correlated with the existence of ultralight axions. Next, I will show how one can use these tools to obtain exponentially small flux superpotentials in the presence of strongly warped throats in compactifications of type IIB string theory, as required by the KKLT mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this talk we show that the pure gauge anomalies of 6d N = (1, 0) theories compactified on a circle are captured by field-dependent Chern-Simons terms appearing at one-loop in the 5d effective theories. These terms vanish if and only if anomalies are canceled. In order to obtain this result, it is crucial to integrate out the massive Kaluza-Klein modes in a way that preserves 6d Lorentz invariance; the often-used zeta-function regularization is not sufficient. Since such field-dependent Chern-Simons terms do not arise in the reduction of M-theory on a threefold, six-dimensional F-theory compactifications are automatically anomaly free, whenever the M/F-duality can be used. A perfect match is then found between the 5d N = 1 prepotentials of the classical M-theory reduction and one-loop circle compactification of an anomaly free theory. Finally, from this potential, we read off the quantum corrections to the gauge coupling functions.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Moduli Stabilisation and the Statistics of SUSY Breaking in
the Landscape</em></p>
<p>Abstract: The statistics of the supersymmetry breaking scale in the
string landscape has been extensively studied in the past finding
either a power-law behaviour induced by uniform distributions of
F-terms or a logarithmic distribution motivated by dynamical
supersymmetry breaking. We point out that the inclusion of the KÃ¤hler
moduli is crucial to understand the distribution of the supersymmetry
breaking scale in the landscape since in general one obtains unstable
vacua when the F-terms of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli
are larger than the F-terms of the KÃ¤hler moduli. After taking KÃ¤hler
moduli stabilisation into account, we find that the distribution of
the gravitino mass and the soft terms is power-law only in KKLT and
perturbatively stabilised vacua which therefore favour high scale
supersymmetry. On the other hand, LVS vacua feature a logarithmic
distribution of soft terms and thus a preference for lower scales of

<p>Title: <em>6D SCFTs and Integrable Spin Chains</em></p>
<p>Abstract: 6D SCFTs associated to long generalized quivers have a large R-charge sector; we find evidence that operator mixing in this sector is governed by a 1D spin chain Hamiltonian with operator scaling dimensions controlled by a perturbation series in inverse powers of the R-charge. When the 6D SCFT is rank R (G, G) conformal matter we study a class of operators where the mixing is controlled by the integrable open Heisenberg XXX_s spin chain, with the spin s depending on the particular ADE-type of G. I will review the construction of such 6D SCFTs and how to build the large R-charge operators from the individual conformal matter building blocks, derive the integrable Hamiltonian capturing the operator mixing, and determine the anomalous dimensions of one class of operators.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Weak Gravity and Dualities</em></p>
<p>Abstract: The mild form of the Weak Gravity Conjecture requires that the charge-to-mass ratio of extremal black holes is shifted to be larger than one. In 4D Einstein-Maxwell theory, much mileage is gained in understanding the effect of higher derivative terms in the effective action along with principles such as unitarity of scattering amplitudes. I will discuss this form of the WGC in the presence of a dilaton, where the usual assumptions are insufficient to demonstrate the conjecture. Adding the assumption that the four-derivative action (approximately) respects a symmetry of the two-derivative action closes this gap.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Swampland Conjectures for Strings and Membranes</em></p>
<p>Abstract:  Swampland criteria like the Weak Gravity Conjecture should not only apply to particles, but also to objects with low codimension, such as strings and membranes in 4D. However, the latter introduce large backreaction effects, making their effective descriptions highly nontrivial. In this talk, focusing on 4D N=1 theories, I will illustrate how to include fundamental strings and membranes within EFTs, showing that the induced backreaction can be regarded as a classical RG flow of their couplings. In turn, this allows for a proper definition of the WGC for strings and membranes. I will further argue that strings and membranes may be helpful tools to thread new links among the conjectures. In particular, I will discuss how the WGC for strings implies the distance conjecture and how WGC-saturating membranes generate a potential satisfying the de Sitter Conjecture.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Orders of Vanishing and U(1) Charges in F-theory</em></p>
<p>Abstract:  There are many interesting questions about the landscape and swampland of F-theory models that involve massless matter charged under U(1) gauge symmetries. As such, it is important to better understand the geometric properties of F-theory models realizing various U(1) charges.  We present evidence that, for F-theory models in Weierstrass form, the U(1) charge of massless matter is encoded in the orders of vanishing of the section components supporting the U(1) gauge symmetry. We propose specific equations relating the U(1) charges to the orders vanishing that seem to hold for both U(1)-charged singlets and for matter additionally charged under a simply-laced nonabelian gauge algebra. Such formulas would provide a method of determining U(1) charges without resolution. Additionally, they give geometric information about F-theory models with general U(1) charges, which may be useful for exploring the F-theory landscape and swampland. Based on upcoming work with Andrew Turner.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Duality and axionic weak gravity</em></p>
<p>Abstract:  The axionic weak gravity conjecture predicts the existence of instantons whose actions are less than their charges in appropriate units. We show that the conjecture is satisfied for the axion-dilaton-gravity system if we assume duality constraints on the higher derivative corrections in addition to positivity bounds which follow from unitarity, analyticity, and locality of UV scattering amplitudes. On the other hand, the conjecture does not follow if we assume the positivity bounds only. This presents an example where derivation of the weak gravity conjecture requires more detailed UV information than the consistency of scattering amplitudes.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Geometric Unification of Higgs Bundle Vacua - Part II</em></p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss an approach to relate M-theory and F-theory on Spin(7)-manifolds via Higgs bundles. We develop solution building techniques for specific bulk BPS equations of motion for local M- and F-theory models. Furthermore, the 3D system unifying the Higgs bundle data associated with 4D N=1 M- and F-theory vacua appears as an interface between different 4D vacua. Similarly, the Pantev-Wijnholt system can be viewed as defining an interpolating profile between 5D N=1 vacua, as captured by the Hitchin system. Thus, I will discuss the resulting interfaces between those supersymmetric vacua. Finally, I will give explicit examples of interpolations between BHV and Pantev-Wijnholt solutions.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Cobordisms, anomalies, and Swampland in nine dimensions</em></p>
<p>Abstract: The oldest and arguably best established Swampland conjecture is that there are no global symmetries in gravity. It is hard to use this to rule out EFTs, since one can often say that a would-be global symmetry is just broken by some obscure UV effect. However, sometimes this breaking forces the introduction of new objects, which can have a gauge anomaly, thus forcing the theory into the Swampland. We will illustrate this in the case of 9d, 8d and 7d supersymmetric theories, where breaking of an unoriented cobordism global symmetry leads to a modulo 8 constraint on the ranks of the gauge group, which matches known string theory constructions. This establishes Coulomb branch string universality in nine and eight dimensions. We also discuss constraints on the possible non-abelian enhancements of the gauge group.</p>

<p>Abstract:  In this talk I will consider the 3D N=1 effective field theory obtained by taking M-theory on a local Spin(7) manifold. I will discuss in detail the system of BPS equation governing supersymmetric vacua in Spin(7) compactification. The Spin(7) system provides a unification of other BPS systems appearing in M-theory and F-theory 4D N=1 vacua and I will show how it is related to the system of 1/2-BPS equations for domain walls in such 4D N=1 theories. Using effective field theory I will argue that these configurations are better interpreted as interfaces of 4D N=1 theories.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Pair Production and Gravity as the Weakest Force</em>.</p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk we will argue for an alternative formulation of the Weak Gravity Conjecture in terms of particle pair production at threshold. Imposing that the production rate by any force mediator (photon or scalar) of pairs of charged particles be larger or equal to graviton production, we recover known conditions for the U(1) WGC and its extensions. Unlike other formulations though, threshold pair production is sensitive to short range couplings present in scalar interactions and gives rise to a Scalar WGC. Application to moduli scalars gives rise to specific conditions on the trilinear and quartic couplings which involve first and second derivatives of the WGC particle mass with respect to the moduli. Some extremal solutions to these equations correspond to massive states behaving like BPS, KK and winding states which feature duality invariance and are in agreement with the Swampland distance conjecture. Conditions for N=2 BPS states saturate our bounds and we discuss specific examples of BPS states which become massless at large Kahler moduli in Type IIA N=2, D=4 CY and orbifold compactifications. We study possible implications for potentials depending on moduli only through WGC massive states.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this talk, I will present an analysis of the charge-to-mass ratio structure of BPS states in general infinite-distance limits of N=2 compactifications of Type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau three-folds, and use the results to sharpen the formulation of the Swampland Conjectures in the presence of multiple gauge and scalar fields. In particular, I will demonstrate a precise relation between the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Swampland Distance Conjecture (SDC), and use this relation to place a bound on the mass decay rate in the SDC in terms of black hole extremality bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this talk I will present part of the results of 2005.05983 on how to use geometric tools in order to analyze 3d interfaces in 4d systems. One key role in this analysis is played by time-reversal invariance and electric-magnetic dualities for generalized Maxwell theories. These further suggest the importance of the real components of the modular curves of SL(2,Z) and its congruence subgroups and allow interesting predictions which can be tested in N = 2 supersymmetric theories.</p>

<p>Title: <em>The web of swampland conjectures and the TCC bound</em>.</p>
<p>Abstract: The swampland program provides criteria to identify low energy effective theories consistent with quantum gravity. However, at present most of these criteria are conjectures and depend on unspecified order one parameters. In this talk, I will test some of these conjectures in specific examples and propose lower bounds for the corresponding parameters. As a byproduct of the analysis, possible relations among conjectures are suggested.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using F-theory, I discuss the construction of non-simply connected gauge and flavor groups in SUGRA and 6D SCFTs using the geometry of elliptic Calabi-Yau&rsquo;s. First I discuss how non-simply-connected symmetries are encoded in globally reduced SL(2,Z) monodromies of the elliptic fiber to a congruence subgroup. By using their modular curves we are able to proof strict bounds on the fundamental group of the gauge group whenever  whenever the base is compact and thus coupled to gravity. Second I discuss how the same structures can be used to construct 6D SCFTs with non-simply  connected Flavor groups when gravity is absent. Here we discuss the difference in the non-Higgsable clusters as well as SCFTs with the same flavor algebra but different group structures.</p>

<p>Title: <em>New Resolutions for F-theory and Chiral Matter in Standard Model-like Constructions</em>.</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard Model-like F-theory compactifications on singular elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 4-folds with flux have received a great deal of attention in the literature for their potential phenomenological applications. Motivated by these constructions, I describe a procedure combining various known computational techniques to determine physical properties of 4D F-theory vacua associated to singular hypersurface Calabi-Yau 4-folds. This procedure can be used to compute flux backgrounds of locally universal models in full generality and can be applied to resolutions at finite Kaluza-Klein radius. I present selected examples and discuss forthcoming results about the tuned [SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)] / Z_6 constructions recently proposed by Raghuram-Taylor-Turner in 1912.10991.</p>
